Below is a concrete, “email first / SMS later” engagement system **plus** a practical reseller/affiliate method you can run *before* you build software. I’m going to treat your users as **Storytellers** (the people recording) and a second audience as **Gift Buyers** (people buying the 20‑minute gift).

---

## 1) Email-first, SMS-later engagement system (non-pushy, expectation-setting)

### A. The core rules that keep it from feeling pushy

1. **One message = one job**
   Every email/SMS should do *exactly one thing*: “record your first 2 minutes,” “choose a theme,” “invite one person,” etc.
2. **Permission-based escalation**
   Start with email. Only use SMS if:

   * they explicitly opted in, and
   * they’re stuck / approaching a deadline / there’s a meaningful status change.
3. **Frequency caps + a “Snooze” escape hatch**

   * Cap “nudges” (non-transactional) at **≤ 2 emails/week** and **≤ 2 SMS/month** for most users.
   * Always include “Snooze reminders for 14 days” (not just unsubscribe) because snoozing feels respectful.
4. **Use “micro-commitments”**
   The system shouldn’t demand “finish your vault.” It should ask for the next 2 minutes.
5. **Progress praise beats guilt**
   “You’re 6 minutes in—amazing. Want a 2‑minute prompt?” will outperform “You haven’t finished…”

---

### B. Data you collect → how you use it to personalize and manage expectations

You said you’re already collecting information. Here’s the minimum data model that turns into effective nudges:

**Profile**

* Preferred name
* Timezone
* Preferred channel (email only vs SMS ok)
* Frequency preference (weekly / biweekly / only milestones)

**Motivation + goal**

* “Who is this for?” (kids, grandkids, partner, self)
* Why now? (birthday, health, legacy project, holiday gift)
* Target cadence (e.g., 10 min/week) or target milestone (e.g., 10 stories)

**Progress**

* Minutes recorded
* # stories completed
* Last activity date
* Has shared/invited anyone?
* Has created a “gift link” / exported / published?

**Friction flags**

* “I don’t know what to say”
* “I’m busy”
* “Tech issues”
* “Privacy concerns”

**What this unlocks**

* If they chose **“kids/grandkids”** → prompts center on family memories.
* If they’re at **0 minutes** after 7 days → “2-minute starter prompt.”
* If they’re at **8–12 minutes** → “You’re close to a meaningful first milestone.”
* If “privacy concerns” flagged → send the privacy reassurance + settings walkthrough (not a prompt).

---

### C. Lifecycle stages (so you’re not blasting everyone)

Define stages; each stage gets its own cadence:

1. **New signup (Day 0–2)**: orientation + first micro-win
2. **Unactivated (Day 3–14, 0 recordings)**: “start small” nudges + offer help
3. **Activated (first recording done)**: reinforce habit + next prompt
4. **Habit-building (weekly recording)**: weekly prompt + monthly progress
5. **Sharing / gifting**: encourage inviting family + gifting 20‑min package
6. **Dormant (7/14/30 days inactive)**: gentle re-entry, then snooze/exit

---

## 2) Cadence: a specific email-first → SMS-later sequence you can implement now

### Stage 1: Signup → First recording (activation)

**Day 0 (immediate) – Email**

* Subject: “Welcome to EchoVault — your first story starts in 2 minutes”
* CTA: “Record 2 minutes now”
* Include: “Most people start with 2 minutes. That’s enough.”

**Day 1 – Email**

* “Pick your first theme” (3 buttons: Family, Work, Love, Lessons)
* This is where you collect personalization data.

**Day 3 – Email**

* “Your 2-minute prompt is ready” (based on theme selection)
* CTA: “Record now”

**Day 5 – Email**

* “What happens after you record” (set expectations: how it’s saved, who can access)
* CTA: “Privacy settings” or “Record another 2 minutes”

**Day 7 – Email**

* “One-week check-in: want weekly prompts or biweekly?”
* CTA: choose cadence (preference center)

**SMS trigger (only if opted-in AND still at 0 minutes by Day 8)**

* SMS: “Hey {Name} — want a 2‑minute starter prompt from EchoVault? Reply PROMPT. Want help getting set up? Reply HELP.”
* (Two-way texting is ideal; if not available yet, link to a prompt page.)

Why this works: you’re using SMS as a *rescue channel*, not a megaphone.

> SMS frequency reality check: most SMS subscribers prefer **once a week or every other week** rather than frequent texts. ([Text Marketing Services][1])

---

### Stage 2: Activated → Habit

**Weekly (Email, once/week max)**

* “This week’s 2-minute prompt” (dynamic based on their goal)
* CTA: record

**Monthly (Email)**

* Progress report: minutes recorded, #stories, last recording date
* “At this pace, you’ll reach {goal} by {date}.”

**SMS trigger (only for meaningful moments)**

* “You’re 2 minutes away from your first 10-minute milestone—want a quick prompt?”
* Or: “Your scheduled session is tomorrow at 3pm—tap to confirm.”

---

### Stage 3: Dormant re-engagement (gentle, not clingy)

**After 7 days inactive – Email**

* “Want an easy way back in?”
* Give 3 options: “Send me a prompt,” “Show me my progress,” “Snooze 14 days.”

**After 14 days inactive – Email**

* “No pressure — should we pause reminders?”
* CTA: Snooze or change cadence.

**After 21+ days inactive (and SMS opted-in) – SMS**

* “Hi {Name} — quick check-in from EchoVault. Want to pause reminders for now? Tap {link}.”
* Make the CTA about control, not guilt.

---

## 3) Message tone: what “EchoVault voice” should sound like

A simple voice guide for every message:

* **Warm, calm, legacy-focused** (not hustle-y)
* **Respectful of time** (“2 minutes is enough”)
* **Privacy-forward** (reassure safety, control)
* **Agency-first** (“Pause / Snooze / Choose cadence”)

Never:

* Shame (“you haven’t…”)
* False urgency (“last chance!”) unless it’s truly a deadline they set (birthday, scheduled session)

---

## 4) Compliance guardrails (practical, not legal advice)

* **Email:** follow CAN‑SPAM basics (unsubscribe, physical address, truthful headers/subject). ([Federal Trade Commission][2])
* **SMS:** treat it as high-risk/high-trust: explicit opt-in, easy opt-out, don’t over-message (TCPA rules evolve and penalties can be significant). ([BCLP Law Firm][3])
* **Influencers/resellers:** require clear disclosure of material connection (“paid partner,” “affiliate link”), per FTC endorsement guidance. ([Federal Trade Commission][4])

---

# Part 2: Resale / influencer / “well-connected people” selling system (run it now, software later)

You’re basically describing **three distinct growth loops**. Don’t force one program to do all three.

## 1) Program lanes (simple, non-MLM, scalable)

### Lane A — “Advocates” (regular customers + friends)

Goal: make sharing and gifting feel natural.

**Mechanic**

* Give them a share link/code:

  * “Give a friend a 20‑minute EchoVault gift”
* Reward is **credit** (best for margins and retention)

**Two-sided incentive (recommended)**

* “Give $10 / Get $10” or “Give 20 minutes / Get $10 credit”
  Two-sided programs are widely recommended because they reward both parties. ([Referral Rock][5])

**Benchmark reality**

* B2C SaaS cost per referral is often **$2–$10**; B2B SaaS **$10–$30**—use this to sanity-check incentives. ([Prefinery][6])

**What to offer**

* Referrer gets: $10–$20 EchoVault credit (or +20 minutes)
* Friend gets: $10–$20 off or a free 20‑minute starter

---

### Lane B — “Affiliates / Creators” (performance-based)

Goal: creators promote to their audience; you pay per paid account.

**Compensation structure**
Typical affiliate commissions often fall in the **5%–30%** range; mature SaaS programs commonly land around **15%–25%** depending on margins. ([Post Affiliate Pro][7])

**Two good options**

1. **Flat bounty per paid account (simple)**

* Example: $30–$80 per new paying customer (depends on your LTV/margins)
* Great for “connectors” doing DMs and intros

2. **Revenue share (better alignment)**

* Example: 20% of first payment OR 20% of first 6 months (or first year)
* Tier up for high performers (e.g., 20% → 25% after 10 sales)

**Payout timing**

* Net 30–60 days is common (to cover refunds/chargebacks), and many affiliate programs use 30–90 day payout windows. ([AFLUENCER][8])

---

### Lane C — “Resellers / Community Partners” (wholesale credits, not MLM)

Goal: people who sell via relationships (senior communities, genealogists, coaches, wedding/family photographers, estate planners).

Instead of “Avon-style buy-in,” do this:

**Wholesale credit packs**

* Partner buys digital “gift codes” at a discount (no physical inventory)
* They resell at MSRP or bundle into their services

Example pack:

* Retail: $50 per 20‑min gift
* Partner pays: $35–$40 per code
* Partner margin: $10–$15 per gift sold (20–30% margin)

This is clean, understandable, and doesn’t look like MLM.

---

## 2) The “Avon model” question: use the *safe* version

A required “premium buy-in” can create reputational risk because it resembles MLM/pyramid mechanics if handled poorly.

**Safe version**

* You can offer an **optional Partner Kit** that includes *real value*, not just “permission to sell”:

  * Includes: 5–10 gift codes (actual product value), templates, training, maybe printed cards
  * Price it so the **codes alone justify most of the cost** (i.e., not a profit center for you)

If you want a “premium tier,” make it about support and materials, not access:

* “Pro Partner” gets:

  * higher commission tier
  * co-branded landing page
  * monthly office hours
  * early product access

---

## 3) Realistic conversion expectations (so partners don’t feel misled)

This is where most reseller programs fail: they overpromise.

### Practical benchmark ranges

Affiliate conversion rates commonly sit around **0.5%–1% average**, with **1%–5%** considered good performance (varies by niche and offer). ([Opensend][9])
Some sources cite averages around ~2% across niches. ([Marketing LTB -][10])

### Translate that into “what a post gets you”

**Assumptions for a typical creator post**

* 10,000 views
* 1% click-through → 100 clicks
* 1–3% conversion → 1–3 purchases

So a creator might generate **1–3 customers per 10k views**, unless:

* they have unusually high trust,
* they do direct outreach,
* the offer is extremely giftable + seasonal.

### What that means for pay

If you pay **$50 per paid account**, then:

* 1–3 conversions = **$50–$150** earnings for that post (performance-only)

That’s why many creators prefer:

* **hybrid deals** (small flat fee + commission), or
* higher commission for limited windows, or
* bundles that convert better (like the 20‑minute gift).

---

## 4) What to pay (a simple “starter” commission schedule)

Here’s a structure you can publish immediately:

### Affiliates/Creators (Lane B)

* **Base:** $40 per new paid account **or** 20% of first payment
* **Tier 2:** $60 per new paid account after 10 monthly conversions
* **Tier 3:** $80 per new paid account after 25 monthly conversions

### Resellers/Partners (Lane C)

* Wholesale discount: 25–35% off gift codes
* Optional “bulk bonus”: buy 50 codes → extra 5% discount

### Advocates (Lane A)

* Give $10 credit / Get $10 credit (or Give 20 minutes / Get $10)

This aligns with common commission benchmarks (5–30% typical), while staying economically sane if your margins support it. ([Post Affiliate Pro][7])

---

## 5) “Voice like EchoVault” partner selling kit (what you hand partners)

To keep messaging consistent, you need a **Partner Playbook** (even if it’s a Google Doc).

### Include these sections

1. **Positioning in one sentence**
   “EchoVault helps you capture meaningful stories in small, easy sessions—so your people can keep them forever.”
2. **3 approved promises** (no exaggeration)

   * “Start in 2 minutes.”
   * “You control privacy and sharing.”
   * “Small recordings add up quickly.”
3. **What not to say**

   * no “guaranteed sales,” no “replace therapy,” no “forever free,” etc.
4. **Objection answers** (short, human)

   * “I don’t know what to say” → “We give prompts. Start with one memory.”
   * “I’m busy” → “Do 2 minutes. That counts.”
   * “Privacy?” → “You choose who sees it; private by default.”
5. **FTC disclosure examples** (required)

   * “Paid partner” / “I may earn a commission”
     The FTC emphasizes disclosure of material connections in endorsements. ([Federal Trade Commission][11])

### Include ready-to-send scripts

* DM script for “connector” types
* Caption templates for creators
* Email template for community partners
* A “gift pitch” script for holidays/birthdays

---

## 6) How to run this *now* without building software

You can run the entire program with Stripe + a spreadsheet for 2–3 months while you validate.

### Minimal operational stack

* **Application intake:** Typeform / Google Form
* **Partner agreement + playbook:** Notion or Google Doc
* **Tracking:** unique discount codes + UTM links
* **Payout log:** Google Sheet
* **Monthly payouts:** PayPal/ACH/manual accounting process

**Tracking methods**

* Each partner gets:

  * a unique coupon code (ECHOPARTNERNAME)
  * and a unique link (UTM parameters)

---

# Part 3: The 20-minute EchoVault Gift package + “credits” system (shareable growth loop)

## The product mechanics (design now, automate later)

* Each gift is a **single-use code** redeemable for:

  * a 20‑minute session (or 20 minutes of recording time)
  * a guided prompt pack
  * optional “share back” link for the gift buyer

## Credits system (to incentivize sharing)

Use a **two-sided** model:

* Referrer gets: **$10 credit** after friend redeems/pays
* Friend gets: **$10 off** (or free 20 minutes)

This is consistent with common two-sided referral examples and best practices. ([Referral Factory][12])

## Fraud controls (keep it clean)

* Reward triggers only after:

  * new customer payment clears OR gift redemption completes
* Cap rewards:

  * e.g., max 5 referral rewards/month per account
* Block self-referrals (same card/email/device)
* Delay payout for affiliates until refund window passes

---

# What I’d implement first (highest impact, lowest complexity)

1. **Define stages + triggers** (signup, first recording, dormant)
2. **Build the activation flow (first 14 days)** with 6–7 emails + 1 optional SMS rescue
3. **Ship the Advocate “gift/share” loop** (codes + credits)
4. **Launch Affiliate lane with flat bounty** (simpler than revenue share at first)
5. Add **Reseller wholesale credits** once the gift package converts well

---

If you tell me your current pricing (or even just: “monthly subscription vs one-time packages, and average order value”), I can plug that into the commission formulas and return a **specific commission table** (what you pay, what it costs you, and what your CAC ends up being) and a finalized **14-day email sequence** written in EchoVault voice.
