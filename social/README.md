# EchoVault Social Launch Kit

This folder is a self-contained helper environment for spinning up EchoVault’s social presence. It includes copy templates, asset specs, and ready-to-export graphics so you can launch without existing accounts.

## How to use
1) Create accounts: X/Twitter, LinkedIn Company, Facebook Page, Instagram, and a YouTube channel for long-form clips. Use `echovault-ai` if available; fall back to `echovaultapp`.
2) Set profile URLs in your bios: `https://echovault-ai.com`.
3) Use the assets and copy templates here; export SVGs to PNG where needed (1200×630 for OG and link previews).
4) Track performance with UTM links: `https://echovault-ai.com/?utm_source={platform}&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=launch`.

## Included
- `copy-templates.md`: Posts for launch, pricing, trust/safety, and storytelling angles tailored per platform.
- `content-calendar.md`: Two-week starter calendar with theme guidance.
- `asset-spec.md`: Sizes, naming, and export guidance for avatars, banners, OG/link previews, and story formats.
- `/public/social/*.svg`: Brand-aligned templates for OG/link preview and announcement cards; export to PNG for platforms that don’t accept SVG.

## Quick checklist
- [ ] Set profile/cover images per `asset-spec.md`.
- [ ] Add bio + link (`https://echovault-ai.com`).
- [ ] Add pinned post with link preview (use `public/social/og-link-card.svg` exported to PNG).
- [ ] Schedule the first 2 weeks from `content-calendar.md`.
- [ ] Reuse copy templates with small tweaks per platform.

When you’re ready to go live, export the SVG templates to PNG (1200×630) and attach to posts for best click-through on LinkedIn/X/Facebook.***
