# Starter Content Calendar (Weeks 1–2)

Publish cadence: 4 posts/week across X + LinkedIn; 3 posts/week on Facebook/Instagram. Reuse copy with light tweaks. Always include `https://echovault-ai.com/?utm_source={platform}&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=launch`.

## Week 1
- Day 1 (Launch): Hero announcement with link preview (use `public/social/og-link-card.svg`).
- Day 2 (How It Works): 3-step explainer; carousel/static with steps summary.
- Day 3 (Pricing): One-time pricing overview; highlight Legacy as “Most Popular.”
- Day 4 (Trust): Encryption/consent/deletion and human-first framing.

## Week 2
- Day 1 (Storytelling): “Don’t wait for a health scare” angle; focus on gentle start.
- Day 2 (Use case): Adult children recording with parents; tie to Gift tier.
- Day 3 (Support CTA): “Help me choose” + human reply; link to pricing/help.
- Day 4 (Reminder): Short nudge to book a session this weekend; emphasize calm guided flow.

## Optional cadence add-ons
- Weekly pinned refresh on X with latest link preview.
- LinkedIn article recap (Week 2): “Why we designed EchoVault for grief, not growth hacking.”
- Instagram Stories: 2–3 slides using `public/social/story-template.svg` (export to PNG).

## Notes
- Keep posts human and calm; avoid “upload your consciousness” language.
- Attach a visual on every link post for higher CTR.
- Rotate CTAs: “Get Started”, “Help me choose”, “See Pricing”, “Talk with a human.”***
