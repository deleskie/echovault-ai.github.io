Replace `{link}` with `https://echovault-ai.com/?utm_source={platform}&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=launch`.

## Launch (all platforms)
- X/LinkedIn: “EchoVault helps you preserve the stories, voice, and wisdom of the people you love—without making it feel like tech. One guided session, a living Echo you can return to anytime. {link}”
- Facebook/Instagram: “We built EchoVault so families can sit down, talk, laugh, and know those stories will always be within reach. Guided interviews, a warm Echo, and private hosting. See how it works: {link}”

## Pricing spotlight
- X: “One-time pricing, long-term peace of mind. Gift $99, Legacy $999, Heirloom $5000. No subscriptions—just the right depth for your family. {link}”
- LinkedIn: “EchoVault offers three one-time tiers to fit different stories: Gift ($99), Legacy ($999), Heirloom ($5000). Each includes guided interviews, secure hosting, and family access. Choose what fits. {link}”

## Trust & safety
- X: “Safety first: encrypted in transit/at rest, access-controlled, never sold, never used to train unrelated systems. You stay in control of what’s kept, shared, or deleted. {link}”
- LinkedIn: “EchoVault treats family stories like an archive, not a growth funnel. Encryption, access controls, consent at every step, and clear deletion on request. Built for trust. {link}”

## Storytelling angle
- X: “Most families say ‘we should record this’ after it’s too late. EchoVault makes it gentle to start now—guided prompts, calm pacing, and a voice you can revisit whenever you miss them. {link}”
- Instagram/Facebook: “It’s the laugh, the pause before advice, the way they tell your favorite story. EchoVault captures those moments with guided interviews so you can return to them whenever you need. {link}”

## How It Works (3 steps)
- “1) Record their story with a guided interviewer. 2) We build a respectful Echo that sounds like them. 3) Your family can talk to it anytime in a private space. See the flow: {link}”

## Gentle nudge / urgency
- “Don’t wait for a health scare to start recording. The clearest memories live in the middle of life, not the end. EchoVault keeps it calm, private, and human. {link}”

## Support CTA
- “Unsure which tier? Tell us who you’re recording for and when you need it—we’ll guide you. {link} or hello@echovault.com”
